# `elasticp`

`elasticp` is a lightweight **adaptive goroutine pool** written in Go.
It provides a simple mechanism for executing high volumes of small CPU-bound tasks using a worker pool with elastic capacity.

### üí° What is it?

This is a **proof of concept** for benchmarking goroutine pools vs spawning native goroutines ‚Äî especially under high concurrency.

It includes:

* A dynamic pool of workers (`Grow`, `Shrink`)
* A `Submit` method that dispatches tasks in a round-robin-like fashion with non-blocking fallback
* A benchmark suite comparing raw goroutines vs `elasticp` under load

### üß™ Benchmarks

Install graphviz
```shell
brew install graphviz
```

Run microbenchmark
```shell
elasticp % go test -bench=. -benchtime=3s -count=1 -benchmem -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof
```

```shell
go tool pprof -http=: mem.prof
```

```shell
go tool pprof -http=: cpu.prof
```

### Results

```shell

```

These test how the pool performs when handling **100,000 parallel / or sequential tasks** operating on shared memory ranges.

### üß¨ Task Model

A `Task` is a unit of work with:

* An `Input` slice of float64s
* An `Output` slice to write the result to
* A `WaitGroup` to signal completion

```go
type Task struct {
	Input  []float64
	Output []float64
	Wg     *sync.WaitGroup
}
```

The pool workers perform simple vector addition:

```go
for i, v := range task.Input {
	task.Output[i] += v
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è API Overview

#### Create a new pool

```go
pool := elasticp.New()
```

#### Grow the pool

```go
pool.Grow(8) // spawn 8 workers
```

#### Submit work

```go
pool.Submit(elasticp.Task{
	Input:  input,
	Output: output,
	Wg:     &wg,
})
```

#### Shrink the pool

```go
pool.Shrink(4) // remove 4 workers
```

### üìà Why?

This POC helps measure:

* The overhead of goroutine creation vs reuse
* The tradeoffs between pool saturation and raw concurrency
* Fair scheduling under CPU-bound workloads

---

### üß† Notes

* This project is designed for benchmarking, not production.
* Tasks must be **independent and stateless**.
* You must call `Wg.Add()` before `Submit()` and `Wg.Wait()` afterward to block until all tasks finish.
